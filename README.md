# not-enough-space



A game about space, and the lack of it.

### Compile project:

Use Maven package to download and bundle dependencies into a single runnable JAR
  
    mvn package
    
### Gameplay:

The goal of the game is to abduct as many cows as possible, while managing not to not pick up any junk and avoiding angry farmers and zooming satellites.

### Controls:

Use WASD or the arrow keys to steer the U.F.O. and use _space_-bar to activate the tractor beam. You can also use Z and X to turn around quickly.

    Make sure to save enough energy to keep the beam available!
